            I love to travel. I have traveled many places in Bangladesh. I have
            visited Cox's Bazar, Bandarban, Rangamati, Sylhet, and many more
            places. I love to travel because it gives me a chance to explore new
            places, meet new people, and experience different cultures.
            Self-motivation is something that does not come easy to a lot of
            people and that means that there are some steps that need to be
            taken before you can become motivated to the fullest extent.
          </p>
          <p class="story-text">
            Traveling is not just about visiting new places, it's also about
            experiencing the journey. The excitement of planning a trip, the
            thrill of exploring new destinations, and the joy of discovering
            hidden gems make traveling an unforgettable experience.
